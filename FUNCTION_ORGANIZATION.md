# Function Organization Principles

This document outlines the logical ordering principles applied to organize functions in the Stockfish-Analyzer codebase.

## Ordering Principles

### 1. Execution Flow Order
Functions are arranged to follow the natural program execution flow, from high-level orchestration down to low-level utilities.

### 2. Abstraction Level
Within each execution flow, functions are ordered from highest abstraction level (main orchestrator functions) to lowest (utility helper functions).

### 3. Dependency Order
Functions that are called by others are placed after their callers when possible, making the code easier to read top-to-bottom.

## Module Organization

### `game_logic.py`
```
play_game                    # Main game loop (highest level)
  ↓ calls
evaluate_and_show_moves      # Move evaluation orchestrator
  ↓ calls  
sort_moves_by_evaluation     # Move sorting logic
  ↓ calls
get_move_score              # Utility function (lowest level)
```

### `engine_handler.py`
```
# Initialization Functions
get_engine                   # Engine setup
get_syzygy_tablebase        # Tablebase setup  
get_dynamic_eval_depth      # Configuration utility

# Main Evaluation Functions
get_move_evals              # Evaluate all moves (highest level)
evaluate_move               # Evaluate single move

# Helper Functions  
try_tablebase_evaluation    # Tablebase helper
get_engine_evaluation       # Engine helper (lowest level)
```

### `board_ui.py`
```
# Basic UI Utilities
clear_terminal              # Terminal utility
print_board                 # Board display
display_progress            # Progress tracking

# Move Display Functions
print_possible_moves        # Show evaluated moves
show_mate_info             # Show mate information
print_tablebase_info       # Show tablebase data

# Game End Functions
print_game_over_info       # Game over orchestrator
print_move_history         # Move history display
print_game_result          # Result display
```

### `input_handler.py`
```
parse_move_input           # Low-level parsing utility
handle_user_input          # High-level input handler
```

## Benefits

1. **Readability**: Code flows naturally from high-level concepts to implementation details
2. **Maintainability**: Related functions are grouped together logically
3. **Understanding**: New developers can follow the execution flow top-to-bottom
4. **Debugging**: Easier to trace through call chains in the natural order

## Validation

All reorganization was validated with:
- Full test suite (41 passed, 7 skipped - unchanged from before)
- MyPy type checking (success: no issues found)
- Import validation (all modules import successfully)
- Equal line changes (150 additions, 150 deletions - pure reorganization)
